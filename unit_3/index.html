			<p>Hello and welcome to Know the Code.</p>

			<p>I was introduced to coding in 2015, when my brother-in-law recommended I consider a career in tech after finishing university. I decided that I wanted to know more and attended a seminar. I could not believe what I had been missing out on and knew I had to learn more.</p>

			<p>I have watched technology evolve around me and  seen how endless the opportunities are. If you want to be relevant in our technical age, you need to be able to program.</p> 

			<p>Like the majority of industries, it is male-dominated. It is interesting that there is a perceived notion that gender equity is a thing of the past, but when you start to look, you realise we have a long way to go. Gender equality involves everyone to be part of the conversation, which means that it is inclusive. In order to create change, the conversation needs to be opened up to everyone, both men and women. 

			<p>I will be interviewing individuals who work within the technology industry, gathering insights, busting stereotypes and sharing my story as I delve into the unknown.</p>  

			<p>Don't hesitate to contact me if you would like to offer advice, would like advice or just want to have a chat. </p>
